/**
 * Helper functions to get which register to use for a certain pin id.
 * The Renesas RH850's registers are spread out in memory and the registers
 * are not in sequential order.
 *
 * To set a register, for example Port Input Buffer Control Register, the
 * first step is to go from Pin Id to Port Group using the "PinIdToPort"
 * array. For example PinId 1 => P10_3. From there the base address for the
 * register for this port group is looked up in the "regs" array.  The
 * register address is then stepped using the portnr, 10. Finally the bit, 3,
 * is used to set the correct bit in the register.
